    Installed Python and Jupyter on my computer in my root directory so I can run a Jupyter nb
    Read the Jupyter docs to figure out how to use pandas with jupyter
    installed pandas in my virtual env in my project folder in src
    Tried to import pandas in a jupyter nb saved in my housing project folder - didn't work
        - do I need to start my Jupyter nb in my virtual env where pandas is intalled?
        - can I just run the interactive ipython on vagrant and import pandas?
