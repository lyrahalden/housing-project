Project Diary Day 1 - 9/25

Goals for today -
- examine the datasets I have picked from the Socrata API
- look at a source for rental price - Zillow?
- figure out how to use Jupyter with pandas

Process Goals -
- take a stretch break every hour
- record start and end times of work


What I Did Today:
11am
    Installed Python and Jupyter on my computer in my root directory so I can run a Jupyter nb
    Read the Jupyter docs to figure out how to use pandas with jupyter
    installed pandas in my virtual env in my project folder in src
    Tried to import pandas in a jupyter nb saved in my housing project folder - didn't work
        - do I need to start my Jupyter nb in my virtual env where pandas is intalled?
        - can I just run the interactive ipython on vagrant and import pandas?
12pm
    - asked for help
    - spent an hour with Jen troubleshooting

1-2
    Lunch

2-2:30
    Troubleshot w/Henry
    conclusion: my computer is too slow to run jupyter

2:35
    started working on lab computer

3pm
    got Pandas to work in Jupyter
    started manipulating the 2014 housing inventory dataset
    set up project folder and github repository
    realized I will need some kind of Google Maps layer to figure out what neighborhood the units are in.

4pm
    investigated whether Zillow's API is a possibility
    decided Zillow won't give me the right info
    isolated the 2014 Q1 new construction data
    confirmed that the neighborhood categories are reasonable
    I will have to get the user's location, then ask Google Maps what neighborhood the location is in, then cross-reference that with the neighborhood names in the table.

5pm
    asked Henry - Google Places API
        can start with a dropdown where the user picks from a list of neighborhood names
    cleaned up jupyter nb duplicates
    trying to read json in from a saved file
        failed, not sure what parameters to use, keep getting ValueErrors
    no limit on Socrata API calls as far as I'm aware(??)
